I'm a Cyber security enthusiast with a passion for learning. I'm currently really interested in Bash and Python as scripting languages. But I also love to get my hands dirty and play with everything I can get my hands into. At the moment I'm also really engaged with reverse engineering and finally starting spending some time Bug Bounty Hunting. 

The files you can find here are written in Bash or Python. Which usually are ideas that come to me after getting into a challenge or situation in which I feel the need to automate a little process or replicate a certain tool that I commonly use (Which I find really interesting as both learning process and a fun time!)

If you have a question, comment, or if you just want to chat, feel free to contact me! I'll be happy to learn and grow along with the community.
