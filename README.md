Hi, Iâ€™m @alex-matty (A.K.A. Meganuke)

I'm a Cyber security enthusiast with a passion for learning. I'm currently really insterested in BASH, but I also love to get my hands dirty and play with everything I can get my hands into. A little bit of python, TryHackMe, Linux, servers. You name it.

The files you can find here are written in Bash, don't know why but I find bash extremely attractive. I am enjoying studying, learning and practicing it.

If you have a comment, question or anything you want to say to me, feel free to reach out to me.
