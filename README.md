I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for learning. Currently, I'm really interested in Bash, Python, and Ruby as scripting languages, but I love to get my hands dirty. The more you learn, the better you'll become!

Right now, I'm also deeply engaged in reverse engineering and have started spending some time on bug bounty hunting. You might find some simple scripts here to help with bug bounties.

The files you can find here are written in Bash, Python, or Ruby, but I'm also eager to dive into low-level languages like Java or C. The scripts here are ideas that come to me after tackling a challenge or situation where I feel the need to automate a process or replicate a tool I commonly use. I find this approach both an interesting learning process and a fun time! I hope you find something useful here. Together, we can develop a better world.

As a cybersecurity practitioner, I believe it's imperative to know how to code to understand how things work. You can't defend what you don't understand, and you can't attack what you don't know. Computers run on code, so understanding code will help you understand computers.

If you have a question, comment, or just want to chat, feel free to contact me! I'll be happy to learn and grow along with the community.
